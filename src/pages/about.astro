			<p class="mb-2 text-base">Hi folks my name is Gary Malkuch. I'm a born and raised native Oregonian. Ever since I was a kid I've always enjoyed science and biology especially when it comes to nature. I love my job because I get to put that into practice. I started working for myself out of high school in 2008.</p>
			<p class="mb-2 text-base">I feel privileged to have worked for and been trained by, in my opinion, some of the best gardeners, arborist, and tree climbers, that the Pacific Northwest has to offer. I have received tree climbing training from 4 different expert arborists. I have received tree work training from 5 expert tree fallers. And I have also received training and supervision by 2 Master Gardeners. I have taken all of that knowledge and training and put it into my company. I have a keen interest in the health and preservation of trees, and the safety and protection of my clients.</p>
			<p class="mb-5 text-base">So whether trimming, removing, cabling, stump grinding, fertilizing, or injecting your trees I want to make sure that you get the best service and experience possible and that your trees are healthy and that you are happy with them. Remember a healthy tree is a safe tree. So contact us today to set up an appointment.</p>

He promptly returned my initial phone call and had reasonable pricing (I called some other well known arborists but they were too busy to even return my calls- and others were booked months out). When I asked Gary questions about my mature pear and camellia trees, he had very knowledgable advice about their growth behavior, which I appreciated. Lastly, he showed up on time and got the job done very efficiently. Cleaned up all the mess before he left too! Will be calling for all my future tree trimming and pruning needs.`,
