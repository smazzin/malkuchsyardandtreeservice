    "content": "Hi folks my name is Gary Malkuch. I'm a born and raised native Oregonian. Ever since I was a kid I've always enjoyed science and biology especially when it comes to nature. I love my job because I get to put that into practice. I started working for myself out of high school in 2008. <br>I feel privileged to have worked for and been trained by, in my opinion, some of the best gardeners, arborist, and tree climbers, that the Pacific Northwest has to offer. I have received tree climbing training from 4 different expert arborists. I have received tree work training from 5 expert tree fallers. And I have also received training and supervision by 2 Master Gardeners. I have taken all of that knowledge and training and put it into my company. I have a keen interest in the health and preservation of trees, and the safety and protection of my clients. <br> So whether trimming, removing, cabling, stump grinding, fertilizing, or injecting your trees I want to make sure that you get the best service and experience possible and that your trees are healthy and that you are happy with them. Remember a healthy tree is a safe tree. So call today to set up an appointment. Check out our latest updates on Google for some great pictures, updates, and interesting facts.
